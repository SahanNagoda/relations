The Supplier hereby reserves all rights to the Software, except for rights expressly granted to the Licensee (acting as an End User) under this Agreement.

This Agreement shall enter into force on the date the Licensee agrees to the terms specified in this Agreement. The Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by permanently uninstalling and destroying the Software, all its backup copies, and any related materials provided by the Supplier or its trading partners or by returning these products at their own expense.

The Licensor declares that developing any software in such a way that it is free from defects and operates flawlessly under all possible conditions, configurations, and operating systems is not possible. The Licensor ensures that all possible and currently known actions have been taken to ensure that the Software operates correctly and is free from errors. However, this does not mean that the Software is free from defects and errors, despite multiple tests being conducted. Therefore, the Licensor is responsible for the Software as described in this paragraph. The Licensor does not guarantee that the Software will be continuously available, secure, and error-free, and any defects and errors in the Software will be corrected. The Licensee agrees that it is not possible to create software that is completely free from defects and errors in all possible conditions, configurations, and operating systems. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Licensor provides the Software for use on an "as is" basis, without any warranties, express or implied, or guarantees or rights of recourse, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights (including intellectual property rights), unless the Terms of Service expressly grant specific rights to the Licensee. If the Licensee fails to comply with the rules for using the Software, as stipulated in the License and in the Terms of Service, or if the Licensee makes changes to the Software without the Licensor's consent or instructs third parties to make changes, the Licensor shall be completely released from any liability (including statutory liability). To the fullest extent permitted by law, especially the laws protecting the interests of consumers, in no event shall the Licensor, nor its employees, collaborators, or members of its bodies, be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, including, but not limited to, lost profits, loss of data, loss of use, reputation, or other intangible assets, arising from access to or lack of access to, or use or inability to use, the Software, actions or content of other users or external entities, or unauthorized access, use, or changes to content, regardless of whether the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Regardless of the above, in no event shall the total liability of the Licensor to a User who is not a Consumer, for all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, exceed the amount of fees paid or due to be paid by the User to the Licensor for the acquisition of the Software license during the 3-month period immediately preceding the occurrence of the event causing the damage. The limitation of liability for damages, as mentioned in the preceding sentence, applies regardless of the basis of liability (breach of terms, contract, statute, and others), regardless of the manner of non-performance of the obligation, and also with regard to any events related to the Agreement. Any defects or errors in the Software should be reported to the Licensor immediately upon discovery by the Licensee at adminjs@adminjs.co. The report should provide a detailed description of the defect or error, as well as include screenshots or other materials documenting the defect or error. Acceptance of the report by the Licensee does not constitute an obligation to remedy the defect or error. Any defects and errors will be rectified by the Licensor immediately upon discovery, but no later than in the next update or provision of an updated file containing corrections. If it is technically possible and necessary due to the consequences of a defect or error, the Licensor may propose to the Licensee, until the defect or error is finally remedied, the implementation of a temporary solution allowing the defect or error to be bypassed until an update is released. The Licensee may not demand a reduction in remuneration for the time taken to remedy the defect or error.

If the User acquired the Software as a Consumer, none of the provisions of this Agreement limit their statutory rights protecting Consumers' interests.

All complaints or reports regarding the Software and Documentation should be addressed to adminjs@adminjs.co.

The license fee is non-refundable, even if the Licensee stops using the Software and/or ceases to use support and updates or access to them.

This agreement is subject to the legal regulations in force in Poland.

Recognition of any provision of this Agreement as invalid or unenforceable does not affect the validity of other provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in force in accordance with the terms specified in this Agreement.

In case of any questions regarding this EULA agreement, please contact us at adminjs@adminjs.co.
